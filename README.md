# Homework 5 - Object Transformation without Mutation

## Due Date

TBD

## Goals

- The purpose of this homework is to learn about instance method chaining without
  mutating the original object.  For example, if we were in `irb`, one can do
  the following:

  ```
  person = Person.new('giovanni')
  puts person # => "giovanni"
  person.titlelize.upcase.reverse.undo # =>"GIOVANNI"
  ```

## Test Driving The Person class

- change directory to the project directory

  ```
  $ unzip fh-homework-05.zip
  $ cd /path/to/fh-homework-05
  $ rm -rf .git
  $ bundle install
  ```

- implement the following `Person` class methods:

  - to_s - returns to the string representation of our person instance

  - titlelize - converts the first character of the first_name to uppercase

  - upcase - converts all the characters of the first_name to upper case

  - downcase - converst all the characters of the first_name to lower case

  - reverse - reverses the characters of the first_name

  - hyphenize - adds a hyphenize between each character of the first_name

  - undo - reverses the most recent transformation

  Note: transformations should not modify the state of the original Person
        instance.  Thus, I would recommend coming up with a data structure
        for maintaining the history of the transformations.

- executing the tests

  - running all the tests

    ```
    $ cd /path/to/fh-homework-05
    $ rspec
    ```

  - running a specific test

    ```
    $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:4 # Person #new
    $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:10 # Person #to_s
    $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:18 # Person #titlelize
    $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:26 # Person #upcase
    $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:34 # Person #downcase
    $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:42 # Person #reverse
    $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:50 # Person #hyphenize
    $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:58 # Person #undo
    ```

    Note:  You will not need the comment at the end of the line when
           executing a specific test.  For example,

           ```
           $ rspec ./spec/person_spec.rb:4
           ```

## Deliverables

- Please create a repo called `fh-homework-05` on Github.com and push your
  finished work there.
